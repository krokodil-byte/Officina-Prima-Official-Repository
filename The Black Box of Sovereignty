The Black Box is a simple, physical, tamper-proof device designed to embody and protect the key to freedom and democratic integrity. It operates as an analog mechanism that generates random numbers by rotating individual digits at different speeds and directions. Just a few rotations of each digit produce extreme randomness.

This physical randomness ensures transparent and verifiable vote selection during referendums, making manipulation impossible without physical access.

Because it is a tangible, mechanical device, no one can secretly interfere or manipulate the democratic process remotely. Any attempt to attack democracy must be physical, allowing defenders to protect the process through concrete means.

By providing an incorruptible, concrete anchor to democracy, the Black Box guarantees that sovereignty truly belongs to the people, safeguarded against hidden manipulation and coercion.
