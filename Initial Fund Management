Initial Fund Management
In the project’s initial phase, the collection and management of funds will be personally overseen by the founder with full transparency and accountability. These funds will be used to:

Translate all official documentation into multiple languages to reach a global audience;

Conduct a large-scale international voting and petition campaign;

Launch the construction of essential infrastructures, such as the Popular and Technical Congresses;

Develop and produce the “Black Boxes of Sovereignty,” physical and secure tools to ensure verified and independent voting.

All expenses and financial operations will be publicly accounted for to guarantee that funds are used solely for the project’s purposes.
